<p>We're an innovative, dedicated group of people who work really hard so you don't have to.</p> <p>We have years of experience in the fundraising industry and thought, there has to be a better way.</p>
<p>We strive to make our fundraising campaigns powerful enough for large groups, and even threw in a "Fast Track" campaign for the little guys that need cash quick. We take pride in offering our Coaches, Admins, and Group Leaders 24/7 support, and care deeply about our Parents, who shoulder the majority of the burden of raising the funds for their kids. We strive to make our ALL IN process secure, effective and super easy to use. It is powerful behind the scenes, yet easy enough for a grandma in Kansas to show her support.<p> Additionally, we pack our solutions with over a decade of trusted experience. We're a committed partner and never beat our own chest.</p> <p>We love it when our Clients say "Look at them"</p>
